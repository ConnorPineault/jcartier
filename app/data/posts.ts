      content: `Here I sit, with my good pal Luke Bailey. We have just complete a long day of work, and are packing for our spring break trip to Cancun. We are terribly excited, as this is our final spring break of University and we have a group of 70+ people coming with us!
Currently, I am listening to The 1975, one of my favourite bands. My ex girlfriend turned me onto them. They’re great. She was great. Everything is great. I have been very optimistic lately, and understandably so given my current circumstances. I am in a position where a lot of hard work has paid off. I got into the program I had been trying to get into, I live with my best-friends in an amazing student ghetto house. Everyone lives within a 3 minute walk away, and when I say I live close to campus, I literally could not be closer. Life is good. I am enjoying every single moment. I am grateful for every second I get to be here. I believe it’s a mindset. You have to foster positivity, attract it you know? Wherever you go, there you are type of stuff. Anyway, here’s to my first post, I am excited to start writing my thoughts down, don’t know if its an ego problem but I feel like I have some cool stuff to say. I don’t know where this will go, if anywhere, but it’s something Ive been wanting to do for a while so here we are. Expect more in depth thought pieces rather than general updates. Consider yourselves lucky you even got an introduction at all. ( Kidding (; ). Here are some of the topics I expect to get into down the line: 
University ending
Emergence as an adult 
Insecurity for future
High value friends/self
Functional stoicism
Lessons from relationships 
Nostalgia
Tech journey
Technologies
Future of tech
Impossibility of getting a job
Tattoos
Bourdain
Music / guitar / songs 
Travel stories
Sheltered ness
Privilege 
Choosing your hard and more

Talk soon, 

Connor`,
